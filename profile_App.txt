Let me introduce myself. I am an experienced software developer with bachelor degree with honours in applied computer science field.
I am a competitive programmer, therefore I understand the importance of using the correct data structure and applying proper algorithms to get the most optimal solution in terms of time and space.
If you take a look at my profile, you will notice that I have high rehire rating, therefore you can assume that I always make sure that clients are satisfied.

Since you didn't provide much details about the project, I would like to talk to you about it so I can gather details I need to provide you the premium quality solution to your problem.

Send me a message and I will let you know if I can help you.

Hopefully we will work together in the future and create a long-term partnership/friendship.
Good luck with your project.
