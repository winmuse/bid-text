Nice meet you.
I've been doing HTML 5 with FLEX a long time.
However, as the canvas technology of HTML 5 increased from 3 years ago, FLEX(create *.swf) was rarely used.
But I have deep knowledge of FLEX language MXML and ASTION SCRIPT language so I can carry out your project.
I can use the swf-decompiler tool to pull out the swf's code and convert it to HTML5.
I look forward to your cooperation.
Thank you for your cooperation!
